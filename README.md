# SpecFlow

A structured prompt system for managing feature development through AI assistants (Claude and Gemini). SpecFlow enforces a systematic, spec-driven approach with defined phases and explicit approval workflows.

## Overview

SpecFlow guides development through seven sequential phases:

1. **Architecture Analysis** - One-time codebase documentation
2. **Feature Creation** - Initialize feature specification
3. **Research** - Feature-specific investigation
4. **Requirements** - User stories and acceptance criteria
5. **Design** - Technical architecture and components
6. **Tasks** - Atomic implementation breakdown
7. **Execute** - One-by-one task implementation

Each phase requires explicit user approval before proceeding to ensure alignment and quality.

## Installation

### Option 1: Fork and Git Subtree (Recommended)

Fork the repository to customize SpecFlow for your needs, then add it as a subtree:

```bash
# 1. Fork https://github.com/bebsworthy/specflow on GitHub
# 2. Add your fork as a subtree in your project's .spec folder
git subtree add --prefix=.spec https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/specflow.git main --squash

# 3. Run the setup script
.spec/setup.sh
```

To update from your fork later:
```bash
git subtree pull --prefix=.spec https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/specflow.git main --squash
```

Benefits of forking:
- Customize workflows for your specific needs
- Add project-specific templates and commands
- Maintain your own improvements
- Contribute back via pull requests

### Option 2: Manual Clone

Clone and copy the files to your project:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/bebsworthy/specflow.git

# Copy to your project's .spec folder
cp -r specflow/* /path/to/your/project/.spec/

# Run the setup script
cd /path/to/your/project/.spec && ./setup.sh
```

## Setup

After installation, run the setup script:

```bash
# Interactive mode
./setup.sh

# Or specify your AI assistant
./setup.sh claude  # For Claude
./setup.sh gemini  # For Gemini
./setup.sh all     # For both
```

The setup script will:
- Create necessary directory structures
- Configure AI-specific command files
- Add workflow references to CLAUDE.md or GEMINI.md

## Usage

### First Time Setup
```bash
/spec:architecture  # Analyze and document your codebase (one-time)
```

### Feature Development
```bash
/spec:1_create feature-name "Feature description"  # Create new feature spec
/spec:2_research feature-name                      # Research codebase context
/spec:3_requirements                               # Generate requirements
/spec:4_design                                     # Create technical design
/spec:5_tasks                                      # Break down into tasks
/spec:6_execute 1                                  # Execute task #1
```

### Utility Commands
```bash
/spec:status feature-name  # Check feature status
/spec:list                 # List all specifications
```

## Key Principles

- **Sequential Phases**: Follow the workflow order without skipping
- **Explicit Approval**: Each phase requires user confirmation
- **Atomic Tasks**: Execute one task at a time during implementation
- **Requirement Traceability**: All tasks reference specific requirements
- **Documentation First**: Every phase produces documentation
