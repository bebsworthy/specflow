# TypeScript Best Practices: A Guideline

## **1. The Guiding Philosophy**

Our primary goal is to write code that is **readable, consistent, and robust**. These guidelines exist to help us leverage TypeScript's power to achieve that together. When a rule seems unclear, we should default to what best serves clarity and long-term maintainability for a future developer. This document turns the type-checker from a hurdle into a collaborative tool for success. üèÜ

## **2. Project Configuration: The Foundation of Safety**

A project's `tsconfig.json` is its constitutional document for type safety. Getting it right is the first step.

### **Rule: Enable `strict` Mode**

**Always** enable all strictness flags by setting `strict: true` in your `tsconfig.json`.

*   **Why:** This is the single most important setting in a TypeScript project. It activates all strict type-checking options (`noImplicitAny`, `strictNullChecks`, `useUnknownInCatchVariables`, etc.), providing the highest level of type safety and catching entire classes of bugs at compile time.

*   **Example:**

    ```json
    // ‚ùå Bad: A permissive configuration that allows for unsafe code.
    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        "strict": false 
      }
    }

    // ‚úÖ Good: Enforce the highest level of type safety from the start.
    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        "target": "ES2022",
        "module": "ESNext",
        "lib": ["ES2022", "DOM"],
        "strict": true,
        "esModuleInterop": true,
        "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true
      }
    }
    ```

*   **Tooling:** This is enforced by the TypeScript compiler via `tsconfig.json`.

## **3. The Art of Precise Typing**

Effective typing involves choosing the right constructs to model data accurately and safely.

### **Rule: Use `interface` for Object Shapes, `type` for Compositions**

**Use** `interface` to define the shape of objects and classes. **Use** `type` for creating union types, intersection types, or aliasing primitives and tuples.

*   **Why:** This convention provides consistency. `interface` is ideal for object-oriented patterns because it can be extended and implemented. `type` is more readable and flexible for combining existing types.

*   **Example:**

    ```typescript
    // ‚úÖ Good: Use `interface` for object shapes.
    interface User {
      id: number;
      name: string;
    }

    // ‚úÖ Good: Use `type` for a union of string literals.
    type UserStatus = "active" | "inactive" | "pending";
    ```

### **Antipattern: The `any` Dilemma**

**Avoid** using the `any` type. It is a dangerous escape hatch that disables type-checking.

*   **Why it's harmful:** Using `any` introduces a "type virus." Any value derived from an `any` type also becomes `any`, silently dismantling the type safety net across your application. This defers type errors to runtime, which is precisely what TypeScript aims to prevent.

*   **The Preferred Alternative:** **Use** the `unknown` type for values from external sources (like API responses). `unknown` forces you to perform a safe runtime check (like a type guard) before you can operate on the value.

*   **Example:**

    ```typescript
    // ‚ùå Bad: `any` allows unsafe property access, leading to runtime errors.
    async function fetchUserUnsafe(id: number) {
      const user: any = await (await fetch(`/api/users/${id}`)).json();
      console.log(user.profile.name); // Compiles, but will crash if `profile` doesn't exist.
    }

    // ‚úÖ Good: `unknown` forces a check, preventing runtime errors.
    async function fetchUserSafe(id: number) {
      const user: unknown = await (await fetch(`/api/users/${id}`)).json();
      if (isUser(user)) { // isUser is a custom type guard
        console.log(user.profile.name);
      }
    }
    ```

### **Antipattern: Overusing Type Assertions**

**Avoid** using type assertions (e.g., `value as string`) to silence compiler errors.

*   **Why it's harmful:** An assertion is not a safe type conversion; it is a compile-time instruction that removes the compiler's safety checks. If the assertion is incorrect, it will lead to a runtime error. It is often a sign that your types are modeled incorrectly.

*   **The Preferred Alternative:** **Use** user-defined type guards or type narrowing to safely validate the shape of data at runtime.

*   **Example:**

    ```typescript
    // ‚ùå Bad: Unsafe assertion that can easily lead to a crash.
    const response: unknown = { name: "Alice", age: 30 };
    const user = response as { name: string; email: string };
    console.log(user.email.toLowerCase()); // CRASHES: user.email is undefined

    // ‚úÖ Good: A type guard performs a runtime check.
    function isUserWithEmail(value: unknown): value is { name: string; email: string } {
        return typeof value === 'object' && value !== null && 'email' in value;
    }

    const response: unknown = { name: "Alice", age: 30 };
    if (isUserWithEmail(response)) {
        console.log(response.email.toLowerCase()); // Safe
    }
    ```

## **4. Designing with Immutability**

Design with immutability to reduce side effects and create more predictable code.

### **Rule: Prefer Immutability**

**Use** TypeScript's `readonly` modifier and `as const` assertions to enforce immutability at compile time.

*   **Why:** Preventing data from being changed after it's created is a powerful strategy for reducing bugs, especially in complex applications with shared state. It makes code easier to reason about.

*   **Example:**

    ```typescript
    // ‚úÖ Good: Use `readonly` for properties that should not change.
    interface Config {
      readonly apiKey: string;
      readonly endpoint: string;
    }
    const config: Config = { apiKey: "abc", endpoint: "/api" };
    // config.apiKey = "def"; // Compile-time error

    // ‚úÖ Good: Use `as const` for deeply immutable constants.
    const COLORS = ["red", "green", "blue"] as const;
    // COLORS.push("yellow"); // Compile-time error
    ```

---

## **5. Structuring Code for Clarity**

A well-organized project is easier to navigate, understand, and scale.

### **Rule: Follow Naming Conventions**

**Use** standard naming conventions to improve readability.

*   **Why:** A consistent naming scheme makes the code's structure and intent clear at a glance, reducing cognitive load for everyone on the team.

*   **The Conventions:**
    *   **`PascalCase`** for types, interfaces, enums, and classes (e.g., `interface UserProfile`).
    *   **`camelCase`** for variables, functions, and properties (e.g., `const userId`).
    *   **`CONSTANT_CASE`** for top-level or static constants (e.g., `const MAX_RETRIES`).
    *   **`kebab-case`** for filenames (e.g., `user-profile.component.ts`).

### **Rule: Prefer Named Exports**

**Always** use named exports. **Avoid** default exports.

*   **Why:** Named exports are explicit, which prevents naming inconsistencies. They also make it significantly easier to search for all usages of a component and enable more reliable automated refactoring.

*   **Example:**

    ```typescript
    // ‚ùå Bad: The name can be different in every file that imports it.
    export default class UserProfile { /* ... */ }
    import MyProfile from './user-profile'; // Inconsistent naming

    // ‚úÖ Good: The name is consistent and discoverable.
    export class UserProfile { /* ... */ }
    import { UserProfile } from './user-profile'; // Clear and consistent.
    ```

### **Antipattern: Copy-Pasting Type Definitions**

**Avoid** manually creating variations of existing types by copying and pasting fields.

*   **Why it's harmful:** This violates the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle and creates a maintenance nightmare. If the original type changes, all copied versions must be found and updated manually.

*   **The Preferred Alternative:** **Use** TypeScript's built-in utility types (`Pick`, `Omit`, `Partial`, etc.) to derive new types from a single source of truth.

*   **Example:**

    ```typescript
    interface User {
      id: number;
      name: string;
      email: string;
    }

    // ‚ùå Bad: Manually creating a partial type.
    interface UserUpdatePayload {
      name?: string;
      email?: string;
    }

    // ‚úÖ Good: Deriving the type ensures it stays in sync with `User`.
    type UserUpdatePayload = Pick<User, 'name' | 'email'>;
    ```

---

## **6. Asynchronous Code**

Handle asynchronous operations in a way that is both safe and performant.

### **Rule: Handle Errors Safely**

**Always** treat errors in `catch` blocks as `unknown`.

*   **Why:** You can `throw` anything in JavaScript (an `Error` object, a string, `null`). The `useUnknownInCatchVariables` strict flag enforces this. Assuming the caught error has a `.message` property is unsafe and can lead to a second, unhandled error.

*   **Example:**

    ```typescript
    try {
      // ...
    } catch (error) { // `error` is of type `unknown`
      // ‚ùå Bad: Unsafe access, will crash if `error` is not an object with a message.
      console.error(error.message);

      // ‚úÖ Good: Safely inspect the error before using it.
      if (error instanceof Error) {
        console.error(`Failed to fetch user: ${error.message}`);
      } else {
        console.error('An unknown error occurred:', error);
      }
    }
    ```

### **Antipattern: Sequential `await`**

**Avoid** `await`ing independent promises sequentially.

*   **Why it's harmful:** This turns parallelizable work into a serial process, dramatically slowing down execution.

*   **The Preferred Alternative:** **Use** `Promise.all()` to execute independent asynchronous operations concurrently.

*   **Example:**

    ```typescript
    // ‚ùå Bad: Each request waits for the previous one to complete.
    async function fetchUsersSequentially(ids: number[]): Promise<User[]> {
      const users: User[] = [];
      for (const id of ids) {
        users.push(await fetchUser(id)); // Unnecessary waiting
      }
      return users;
    }

    // ‚úÖ Good: All requests are sent in parallel.
    async function fetchUsersConcurrently(ids: number[]): Promise<User[]> {
      const userPromises = ids.map(id => fetchUser(id));
      return await Promise.all(userPromises);
    }
    ```

## **7. Automating Quality**

A guideline is only effective if it's followed. The best way to ensure this is through automation.

### **Rule: Enforce Standards with Tooling**

**Set up** ESLint and Prettier to automate code quality and formatting enforcement.

*   **Why:** This offloads the cognitive burden of style and quality checks from the developer to the machine. It eliminates style debates in code reviews and guarantees a consistent, readable codebase.

*   **How to make it actionable:**
    1.  **Configure Prettier** (`.prettierrc`) to handle all code formatting.
    2.  **Configure ESLint** (`.eslintrc.js`) with `@typescript-eslint/recommended` to catch potential bugs and enforce best practices. Use `eslint-config-prettier` to disable any ESLint rules that conflict with Prettier.
    3.  **Use pre-commit hooks** with tools like `husky` and `lint-staged` to automatically format and lint staged files before every commit, preventing non-compliant code from ever entering the repository.
