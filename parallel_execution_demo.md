# Parallel Execution Demonstration

This document demonstrates how the `/spec:parallel_execute` command works with the quality-hook feature.

## Current Task Status

Based on the tasks.md file:
- Total Tasks: 32
- Completed: Task 1 ✓
- Pending: Tasks 2-32

## Execution Groups

### Group 1: Can Start Immediately (After Task 2)
These tracks can run in parallel once Task 2 (Core Types) is complete:

- **Track A**: Configuration System
  - Task 4: Implement configuration loader
  - Task 5: Implement configuration validator  
  - Task 6: Create default configuration templates

- **Track B**: Project Detection
  - Task 7: Implement project detector
  - Task 8: Add monorepo detection logic

- **Track C**: CLI Foundation  
  - Task 9: Set up Cobra CLI framework
  - Task 10: Implement core quality commands

- **Track D**: Output Filtering
  - Task 19: Implement output filter engine
  - Task 20: Add intelligent truncation
  - Task 21: Create pattern management system

### Prerequisites
1. Task 2 (Define core configuration types) must complete first as it blocks multiple tracks

### Parallel Execution Command

To execute all remaining tasks in parallel:

```bash
/spec:parallel_execute quality-hook
```

This will:
1. First execute Task 2 (prerequisite)
2. Then launch 4 parallel agents for Tracks A, B, C, and D
3. As tasks complete, launch agents for dependent tasks
4. Continue until all 32 tasks are complete

### Execution Timeline

With parallel execution:
- **Day 1**: Task 2, then start Tracks A-D in parallel
- **Day 2-3**: Continue Group 1, start Group 2 tasks as dependencies are met
- **Day 4-5**: Integration tasks (Group 3)
- **Day 6-7**: Testing, security, and documentation (Group 4)

**Total Time**: ~6-7 days vs 15 days sequential

### How Agents Work

Each parallel agent will:
1. Receive specific task assignments
2. Read the feature context (requirements.md, design.md)
3. Implement the task independently
4. Mark the task as complete in tasks.md
5. Report completion status back

### Example Agent Prompt

```
You are executing Task 4 (Implement configuration loader) for the quality-hook feature.

Context files are in documentation/features/quality-hook/

Task Details:
- Create `internal/config/loader.go`
- Implement JSON file loading from standard paths
- Support environment variable for config path
- Add configuration merging for monorepo paths
- Write unit tests for loader

Requirements: 3.1, 3.3, 3.4

Instructions:
1. Read requirements.md and design.md for context
2. Implement the task as specified
3. Follow Go best practices and project patterns
4. Write comprehensive unit tests
5. Mark task as complete [x] in tasks.md
6. Report completion status

IMPORTANT: Only work on Task 4. Do not proceed to other tasks.
```

### Benefits of Parallel Execution

1. **Speed**: 6-7 days instead of 15 days
2. **Efficiency**: Multiple developers working simultaneously
3. **Independence**: Each track can progress without blocking others
4. **Flexibility**: Can limit parallelism if needed with --max-agents
5. **Automation**: No manual intervention required once started

### Monitoring Progress

The coordinator will provide real-time updates:

```
Progress: 12/32 tasks complete (37.5%)

Active Agents:
- Track A: Implementing Task 5 (configuration validator)
- Track C: Working on Task 10 (core quality commands)
- Track E: Starting Task 13 (command executor)

Completed Tracks:
- Track B: ✓ (Tasks 7-8)
- Track D: ✓ (Tasks 19-21)

Recently Completed:
- Task 4: Configuration loader ✓
- Task 9: Cobra CLI framework ✓

Time Elapsed: 1d 4h 22m
Estimated Remaining: 5d 12h
```

## Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Full Automatic Execution
```bash
/spec:parallel_execute quality-hook
```

### Scenario 2: Limited Resources
```bash
/spec:parallel_execute quality-hook --max-agents=3
```

### Scenario 3: Test Run
```bash
/spec:parallel_execute quality-hook --dry-run
```

### Scenario 4: Specific Track Only
```bash
/spec:parallel_execute quality-hook --track=A
```

### Scenario 5: Resilient Execution
```bash
/spec:parallel_execute quality-hook --continue-on-error
```
